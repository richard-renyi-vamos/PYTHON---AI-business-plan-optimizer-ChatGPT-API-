create a PYTHON code with ChatGPT API that gives recommendations to optimize a business plan
ChatGPT said:
Here's a Python script that uses the ChatGPT API to analyze and optimize a business plan. The script takes a business plan as input (either from a file or user input), sends it to the ChatGPT API, and receives recommendations for improvements.

Business Plan Optimizer

Answer in chat instead
This script allows users to input their business plan either manually or via a file. It then leverages the ChatGPT API to provide actionable recommendations for improvement. Let me know if you need modifications! ðŸš€
